## Amor Fati: Accept what happens

The concept of “amor fati,” was first introduced by Friedrich Nietzsche. Translated as “love of fate” or “love of one’s fate,” it encourages us to embrace everything that happens in our lives, both good and bad, and see it as an essential part of our personal journey.

Nietzsche said that amor fati is the “formula for greatness in a human being.”

He believed that life is full of challenges, setbacks, and triumphs, all of which shape who we are. By adopting amor fati, we learn to accept and even love these experiences, regardless of their nature. 

Instead of resisting or lamenting our circumstances, we can view them as opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

To incorporate amor fati into your daily life, start by acknowledging the events you cannot change and finding value in them. [Practice gratitude for both your successes and struggles](https://dariusforoux.com/underestimated-gratitude/).

When faced with adversity, ask yourself what you can learn from the situation and how it can help you grow. This mindset shift leads to more resilience, positivity, and ultimately, a more fulfilling life. As Nietzsche wrote: 

> ”Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it…but love it.”

* To not only bear the suffering but love it.

Amor fati is a Latin phrase that means "love of fate" or "love of one's fate." It is a philosophical concept that teaches us to accept and embrace everything that happens in our lives, both the good and the bad, without resistance or resentment.

Amor fati is often associated with Stoicism, an ancient Greek philosophy that emphasizes the importance of living a virtuous life in accordance with nature. The Stoics believed that the universe is governed by a rational order, and that everything that happens to us is ultimately for our own good.

To practice amor fati is to see all of our experiences, even the negative ones, as opportunities for growth and learning. It is to understand that the challenges we face are essential to our development as individuals.
Here are some tips for practicing amor fati:

- When something negative happens to you, try to see it as an opportunity for growth or learning. Ask yourself what you can learn from the experience, and how you can use it to become a better person.
- Accept that you cannot control everything that happens to you. Instead of resisting or resenting negative events, focus on what you can control, such as your own attitude and response.
- Be grateful for everything in your life, both the good and the bad. Even negative experiences can help us to grow and learn.
- Emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius/) would say: 
>“A blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is thrown into it.”

Amor fati is not a philosophy that is easy to practice, but it is a powerful one. By learning to love our fate, we can live more resilient and fulfilling lives.

Thomas Edison said: 
>Go get your mother and all her friends, they'll never see a fire like this again.

He not only accepted it but love it. He knew that everything happens for the good.
